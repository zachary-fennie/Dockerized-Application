# Dockerized Application
## A simple python application containerized with a dockerfile. The goal here is to both demonstrate running an application within a docker container (using docker run terminal commands) but to also build a docker image in the CI/CD pipeline which will be pushed to Docker Hub or other container management service.

# Flask App
## A Flask app is a web application built using the Flask web framework, which is a lightweight and flexible framework for building web applications in Python. Flask is often used for creating small to medium-sized web applications, APIs, and microservices due to its simplicity and ease of use.
