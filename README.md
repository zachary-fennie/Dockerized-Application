# Dockerized Application
## A simple python application containerized with a dockerfile. The goal here is to both demonstrate running an application within a docker container (using docker run terminal commands) but to also build a docker image in the CI/CD pipeline which will be pushed to Docker Hub or other container management service.
Includes (but is not limited to):
- .devcontainer
- Makefile
- CI/CD pipeline
- requirements.txt
- README.md
